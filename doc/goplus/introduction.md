# About GoPlus
GoPlus is working as the "Security Infrastructure" for Web3 by providing open, permissionless, user-driven Security Services. It is building on the Security Data Infrastructure and Security Service Platform, making a safer Web3 Ecosystem.
Currently, GoPlus has developed a real-time, dynamic, and automated security detecting platform, including Token Security, NFT Security , Malicious Address , Approval Security , dApp Security Info and Signature Data Decode APIs, with around 5 million data calls every day. GoPlus has also launched the Security Ecosystem in 2023.
We would love to offer the best Web3 security data integration to protect both projects and users in the crypto world. We are also seeking similar-minded partners and influencers for cooperation. Please feel free to contact us if you are interested in accessing GoPlus API, or any other cooperation possibilities.
