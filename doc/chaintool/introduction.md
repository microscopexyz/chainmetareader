# About Chaintool
Chaintool is a Web3 technology company with a mission to foster the goodness of Web3. We are committed to building infrastructure, turning blockchain transaction data into knowledge to make the Web3 economy great. Our team consists of veteran data intelligence professionals, who have built knowledge graphs and crowd-sourcing data pipelines for Pinterest's content recommendations, targeting systems for Alipay's marketing, and risk management systems for a top-tier crypto exchange.

We are motivated by the challenges that constrain the growth of the Web3 industry. The dearth of collaboration in annotating crypto addresses results in expensive and implicitly permissioned data-driven blockchain products. Other hurdles include restrictive regulations that discourage large institutions from investing in crypto, inefficient fraud prevention systems complicating crypto transactions and diminishing user experiences, and issues like Sybil attacks that hinder successful airdrops. In response, we develop protocols and software in partnership with others to tackle these critical and correlated challenges.
